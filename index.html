        <p>In October 2024, Amazon revealed their first fully-autonomous warehouse robot, "Proteus". It can navigate Amazon's fulfillment centers independently, avoid surrounding obstacles, and is designed to transport carts weighing up to 800 lbs. This reduces the amount of heavy lifting performed by Amazon warehouse workers, reducing their risk of injury. Most importantly, it can work up to 20 hours per day and take itself to the designated charging stations.</p>

            <p><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> By increasing warehouse efficiency and automating away repetitive tasks, robotic warehouse automation significantly reduces the number of available warehouse jobs, affecting the livelihoods of workers and their families.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> Robotic warehouse automation concentrates benefits (cost savings, increased warehouse efficiency) in the hands of the corporatons while warehouse workers are faced with job insecurity and the resulting financial hardship. This increasingly widens the economic inequality between corporations and workers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Difficult Job Transition:</strong> Corporations claim to reassign automation-displaced warehouse workers to robot-maintenance adjacent roles. However, there are very few such roles available. And, given the fact that warehouse robots are designed to automate reptitive warehouse tasks, "low-skilled" warehouse workers are likely to struggle finding alternative employment without additional education or retraining.</p>

            <p><strong>Innovation vs. Job Displacement:</strong> Utilitarianism is an ethical philosophy that promotes decision-making based on maximizing benefit and satisfaction for as many people as possible. Although innovation in robotic warehouse automation will greatly benefit corporations and their consumers, it negatively affects the employment and livelihoods of displaced warehouse workers. Therefore, how can we maximize balance the benefits for corporations and consumers while minimizing the negative consequences for workers?</p>

            <p><strong>Innovation vs. Perpetuation of Inequality: </strong> Robotic warehouse automation increasingly widens the inequality between corporations and workers.

The proposal is designed to tax robots that take jobs away from human workers in order to balance out the increasingly widening inequality between corporations and workers.</p>
            <p><strong>Redistribution: </strong> Adding onto the "Robot Tax" proposal by Bernie Sanders, the funds collected from the "Robot Tax" could be used to directly benefit automation-displaced workers. These funds could be used to fund retraining programs or higher-education opportunities for these workers, providing them with the skillset and knowledge to seek new employment opportunities.</p>
            <p><strong>Government Regulations: </strong>Governments could require corporations to retrain workers displaced my automation, allowing them to perform different an alternative function within the company. </p>
